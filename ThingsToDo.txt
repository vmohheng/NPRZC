Down the road...

Create first enemy:
- Fires stuff at you
- Can get hit
- Turns around and stuff. Might move.

Content generation:
- One level for testing

Pathing:
- ACTUAL AI!!

that's actually the entire engine!

Content generation time!
- Weapon system
- Weapons

Feats undone:
- Lucky shot (Power tier 4)
- Lucky spread (Accuracy tier 4)
- Golden reload (Accuracy tier 5)
- The whole ammo tree

Bugs, tests, workarounds:
- Currently bullets move too fast and are too small to be detected by 1 pixel collision. 
	- 1 possible solution is to have bigger bullet masks
	- Or thicker walls. We can "double up" each wall, so no bullet can fit between 2 walls
	- Or with efficient enough algorithm, FULL WALLS
- Currently, mousing over on weapons makes weird stuff happen (Fixed... sort of)
